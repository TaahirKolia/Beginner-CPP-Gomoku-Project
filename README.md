# Gomoku_Game

Gomoku is a Japanese strategy board game which involves two players that take alternating turns to place their pieces (either black or white
pieces) in an empty space with the goal of placing five of their respective pieces in acontinuous line. Generally, the game is played on a 15x15
grid board, however there are other acceptable boards sizes that the game can be played on. 

The aim of this project is to develop and implement two C++ algorithms that play against each other in a game of Gomoku. 

An OOP approach is taken and three files are needed to run the programme. The 'gomoku.h' is the header file that consists of the class declarations.
The 'gomoku.cpp' file consists of the class implementations. This includes the functions for the two algorithms, winning condition checks and board declaration.

The 'main.cpp' file reads in the board sizes from the 'input.txt' and outputs the moves made by each algorithm, until a winner is found, into a .txt file. The board 
sizes may vary from a 6x6 board to a 15x15 board.
